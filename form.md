# Contact Us Component Design Overview

## Section Introduction:
The component begins with an introduction to the "Contact Us" section, utilizing motion effects from the Framer Motion library. Text elements fade in and slide up when they come into view, enhancing visual engagement.

## Contact Information:
The contact information section displays details for a 24/7 support team, including email and phone number. React Icons library icons are used for visual representation, and a map image with a call icon offers a visual depiction of the support team's availability and location.

## Form Section:
Users can input their name, email address, and message in the form section. Formik manages form state, validation, and submission, while Yup handles form validation schema. Tailwind CSS styles the form fields for a clean, modern look, and motion effects create a smooth, interactive user experience. Buttons feature hover and tap animations for visual feedback.

## Submission Feedback:
Upon successful form submission, a success message fades in using Framer Motion, informing users of their submission. The success message disappears after 3 seconds to avoid clutter.

## Overall Design and Styling:
Tailwind CSS utility classes ensure responsive design and consistency across screen sizes. Colors maintain brand consistency and enhance text readability, while font sizes and weights establish visual hierarchy and emphasize important information.

## Interactivity and User Experience:
Motion effects throughout the component enhance interactivity and provide a seamless user experience. Visual feedback, such as animations and feedback messages, improves usability and effectively conveys information.

Overall, the `Contact` component blends form functionality with creative design and interactive elements, offering an engaging and user-friendly contact section.
